# GIRAF - Graphical Interface Resource for Autistic Folks

This GitHub organization hosts the repositories for the GIRAF applications.

## About the Project

GIRAF is a tablet-based application designed for autistic children with limited or no verbal communication skills. It can be used for daily schedules, games, and educational purposes.

Developed by students at Aalborg University as a semester project for the BSc in Software Engineering, GIRAF was initiated in 2011. Currently, it consists of one application called "weekplanner".

The project has been created in close collaboration with BÃ¸rnehaven Birken (Kindergarten), Egebakken (School), and the Center for Autism and ADHD at Aalborg Municipality.

Development is ongoing, with the goal of making the system ready for use within the next few years.
