# Giraf project

Giraf is a tablet environment aimed at autistic children with little or no verbal communication. It can be used for daily schedules, games and education.

The Giraf system has been developed by students at Aalborg University as a semester project on the software engineering education from the spring of 2011. The system has been created in close cooperation with BÃ¸rnehaven Birken (Kindergarten), Egebakken (School) and Center for Autism and ADHD at Aalborg Municipality. The system will be developed continuously and will hopefully be ready for use within the next years.
