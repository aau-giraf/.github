# GIRAF - Graphical Interface Resource for Autistic Folks

This is the GitHub organization hosting the different repositories for the applications in GIRAF.

## About the project

GIRAF is a tablet environment application aimed at autistic children with little or no verbal communication. It can be used for daily schedules, games and education.

The GIRAF system has been developed by students at Aalborg University as a semester project on the Bsc in Software Engineering. The project was created in 2011, and it currently consists of one application called *Weekplanner*. 

The project has been created in close cooperation with BÃ¸rnehaven Birken (Kindergarten), Egebakken (School) and Center for Autisme og ADHD at Aalborg Municipality. 

The system will be developed continuously and it will hopefully be ready for use within the next couple of years.
